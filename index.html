                  <h1>Hi</h1><br></h2>For My Future Husband Kashif Moharvi</h2><br><br>   
<p > I don’t want to wait until your birthday or our anniversary to remind you how much you mean to me. You mean everything. I know I don’t always say how I’m feeling because I have a nasty habit of keeping my heart guarded, 
but I hope you realize how much I care about you. but now you are the only person I would want to have those arguments with.
Even after all of this time, I still get butterflies when you smile at me.I hate being apart from you, but our long distance love gives me something to look forward to each and every day. I keep counting down the moments until I get to feel your arms wrapped around me again, until I get to fall asleep to the sound of your soft breathing, until I get to hear your laugh the second it leaves your lips instead of through the delay of the phone. I love you and I miss you My Beloved Kashif. I cannot wait until the day when we live together. I love you. I love you. I love you. I can never say those three words enough</p>

<h2>May Allah Unite Us Together Soon</h2>
